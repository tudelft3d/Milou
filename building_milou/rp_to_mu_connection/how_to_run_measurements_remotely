How to do make remote measurements with Milou

1- Turn it on and wait for 5 minutes
2- Make sure the SenseLab Laptop is connected to Ethernet
3- Click on the network icon on the bottom right and choose "Wireless Milou" as a network
(N.B.: If you don't see it yet, wait a bit more or refresh the network's list)
4- Plug in the Dantec dongle into the Laptop
5- Open the Dantec software "ComfortSense".
6- If not already open, open VirtualHere (see Downloads).
One window will have "RaspberryPi" with a green dot next to it.
Underneath it, you will see a USB that starts with "NI...".
Right click on that USB and click "Use device"
7- Go to Dantec software and navigate to where you need to go.
8- (Optional) There is a python code to automate the process of measuring the parameters.
Otherwise you can do the measurements yourself :)
